# Numeric Computing with Node.js

> Talk for [SFNode][sfnode].


## Abstract

Node.js and number crunching may seem an odd pair, but this is rapidly changing. In this talk, I discuss the current state-of-the-art for numeric computation in Node.js and highlight emerging technologies and libraries for analysis and machine learning. I discuss what to look for in numeric computing libraries, common implementation mistakes, and how to avoid portability issues. And I conclude by explaining why Node.js is poised to become the next big thing for data science and numeric computation.
